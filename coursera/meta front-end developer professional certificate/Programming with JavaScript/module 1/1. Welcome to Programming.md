> Introduction to Programming with JavaScript
- JavaScript is most well-known for being the programming language of the web.
	- Nearly all of the interactivity you experience online, like drop-down menus or the autocomplete function, is facilitated by JavaScript. 
- Now, it is used not only for the front-end development, but also for back-end development, and you can even create mobile apps using JavaScript and React.
- One of the unique things about JavaScript that no other language has is that it's a language that can be used for writing the front-end and the back-end.
