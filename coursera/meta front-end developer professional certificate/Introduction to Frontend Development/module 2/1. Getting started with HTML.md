> What is Hyper Text Markup Language
- an *HTML document*, Hypertext Markup Language,  is a lot like the frame, is a basic structure assembled with different components such as *tags* and *elements*.
	- These elements form the structure of a web page and describe to the web browser what to display. 

> HTML Documents
- The great thing about ==HTML documents is that they don't have to be hosted on a web server for you to view them in your web browser==. You can save HTML files on your computer and viewed them locally with your web browser.

- I first need to create a standard HTML structure which starts with the DOCTYPE declaration. This notifies the web browser that is a HTML documents.
- Next, I create the HTML tag, which is also known as the HTML root element. 
- Inside the HTML tag, I add two main elements. The head and the body elements. 
- ==Nothing inside the head element is displayed on the webpage in the web browser. In the head element, you add information or metadata about the HTML documents. It is not part of the content of the webpage.==
	- For example, ==inside the head tag, you always create the title elements.== This is the title that is displayed in the web browser tab. 
	- I can also link to ==CSS files and define Meta tags in the head section==. 
	- Meta tags can specify the description of the web page, keywords for search engines and the order of the web page.
- Next up, I add the content of the webpage inside the body tag. 
	- The body can contain elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and videos.

> Adding images to a webpage with HTML
- Images are not inserted into web pages.
	- Instead we use image tags in HTML to link to image files. The image tag then creates a placeholder for the image on the web page.
- There is one important attribute that you should always include with image tags. It is good practice to add a short description for images. 
	- ==It helps improve accessibility for people using assistive technologies and it can also improve search engine rankings.== 
		- You can add image descriptions with the alternative text attribute also known as the alt attribute
