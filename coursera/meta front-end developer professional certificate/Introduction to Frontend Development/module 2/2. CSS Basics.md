> Selecting and styling
![[CSS Rule.png]]
- ==For my web page to use the CSS file, I need to link it to the head element of the html file.== 
	- To link to a style sheet, you use the link tag which must be assigned to attributes rel and href. The rel attribute is assigned to style sheet and the href attribute is assigned to the name of the style sheet file
	![[HTML link to CSS.png]]
- ==CSS has a set of hierarchy rules which dictate which rule will apply to an element.== In this example, the ID rule takes precedence over the html type selector rule.

> Different types of selectors 
- ==Element Selectors== 
HTML
```
<p>Once upon a time...</p>
<p>In a hidden land...</p>- ==ID Selectors== 
```
CSS 
```
p {
	color: blue;
}
```
- ==ID Selectors==
HTML
```
<p>Once upon a time...</p>
<p>In a hidden land...</p>
```
CSS 
```
#latest {
	background-color: purple;
}
```
- ==Class Selectors==
HTML
```
<a class="navigation">Go Back</a>
<p class="navigation">Go Forward</p>
```
CSS 
```
.navigation {
	margin: 2px;
}
```
- ==Element with Class Selector== 
HTML
```
<p class="introduction"></p>
```
CSS 
```
p.introduction {
	margin: 2px;
}
```
- ==Descendent selectors== 
	- The CSS rule will select all h1 elements that are contained within the element with the ID blog. The CSS rule will not apply to the h1 element containing the text Archives.
HTML
```
<div id="blog">
	<h1>Latest News</h1>
	<div>
		<h1>Today's Weather</h1>
	</div>
</div>
<div>
	<h1>Archives</h1>
</div>
```
CSS 
```
#blog h1 {
	color: blue;
}
```
- ==Child selectors== 
	- Child selectors are more specific than descendant selectors. They only select elements that are immediate descendants (children) of a selector (the parent).
	- This will select the element with the ID blog (the parent), then it will select all h1 elements that are contained directly in that element (the children). Note tha the CSS rule will not be applied to the h1 element containing the text Today's Weather.
HTML
```
<div id="blog">
	<h1>Latest News</h1>
	<div>
		<h1>Today's Weather</h1>
	</div>
</div>
<div>
	<h1>Archives</h1>
</div>
```
CSS 
```
#blog > h1 {
	color: blue;
}
```

> Text and color in CSS
- From CSS Version 3, there are five main ways to reference a color. 
	- By ==RGB value==: RGB is a color model that adds the colors red (R), green (G) and blue (B) together to create colors. This is based on how the human eye sees colors.
		- Each value is defined as a number between 0 and 255, representing the intensity of that color like rgb(255, 0, 0)
	- By ==RGBA value==: RGBA is an extension of RGB that add an alpha (A) channel. The alpha channel represents the opacity, or transparency, of the color like rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8)
	- By ==HSL value==: HSL is a newer color model defined as Hue (H), Saturation (S) and Lightness (L) like hsl(0, 100%, 50%)
	- By ==hex value==: Digits range from 0 to 9 before tens and hundreds are used. Hexadecimal is similar, except it has 16 digits. This is counted as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F like #FF0000
	- By ==predefined color names==: Modern web browsers support 140 predefined color names. These color names are for convenience purposes and can be mapped to equivalent hex/RGB/HSL values like black, white, red
- Since computers vary in what fonts they have installed, it is ==recommended to include several fonts when using the font-family property.== 
	- These are specified in a fallback order, meaning that if the first font is not available, it will check for the second font. If the second font is not available, then it will check for the third font and so on. If none of the fonts are available, it will use the browser's default font.

> Box model introduction 
- When an HTML document and CSS style sheet are downloaded, the web browser needs to know how to display the elements on the screen. To do this, it allocates a rectangle or box to each element. CSS rules are applied to the boxes of the elements. This is known as the ==box model==.

> Document flow - block vs. inline 
- By default, nearly all html elements are organized into one of two categories namely in block and in line elements.![[Block vs. Inline HTML elements.png]]
