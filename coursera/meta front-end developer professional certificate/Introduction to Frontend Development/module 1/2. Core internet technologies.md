> Introduction to Internet Protocols
- There is a surprising parallel between the postal system and how the computer sends and receives data across the internet every day.
- Data sent across the internet is quite an important part of our everyday lives and it wouldn't be possible without **Internet Protocol addresses** or *IP addresses*. A useful way to think of IP addresses is that they function much like addresses in a postal system.
- ==Every computer on a network is assigned an IP address==. In protocol version four an IP address contains four octet. It's separated by periods or dots. For example 192.0.2.235.![[IP Address.png]]
- ==When you send data across a network, you send the data as a series of messages called *IP packets*. Also known as *data grams* at a high level IP packets contain a header and a payload or the data.== 
	- ==Like real mail, IP packets include the destination IP address and source IP address.== These addresses are in the header along with some additional information to help deliver the packet. And the payload contains the data of the packet and some of the other protocols.
	- Like real mail issues, IP packets too they can arrive out of order, become damaged or corrupted to in transit or be dropped or lost during transit. To solve these problems, the payload part of the packets contains other protocols too.
- The two most common protocols are the Transmission Control Protocol referred to as TCP and the User Datagram Protocol, also known as UDP. 
	- ==*TCP* can solve all three of the previously mentioned issues but at the cost of a small delay when sending the data. This protocol is used for sending the data that must arrive correctly and in order such as a text or image files.== ![[TCP.png]]
	- ==*UDP* solves the corrupt packet issue but packets can still arrive out of order or not arrive at all.== This protocol is used for sending data that can tolerate some data loss such as voice calls or live video streaming.![[UDP.png]]
	- Both of these protocols contain payloads that contain further protocols inside of them and there you have it.
- These protocols can help to make sure that data arrives in order does not become corrupted or lost or dropped during transit.

> Introduction to HTTP
- *HTTP*, which for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is a core operational protocol of the world wide web. ==It is what enables your web browser to communicate with a web server that hosts a website.==
- HTTP is the communication protocol that is ==request response based== which you use whenever you browse the web. ==It is a protocol used for transferring web resources such as HTML documents, images, styles, and other files.==
- ==A web browser or client sends an HTTP request to a server and the web server sends the HTTP response back to the browser.==
- An *HTTP requests* consists of a method, path, version and headers. ![[HTTP Request.png]]
	- The HTTP *method* describes the type of action that the client must performed.
		- The primary or the most commonly used HTTP methods are, GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. 
		- The GET method is used to retrieve information from the given server.
		- The POST request is used to send data to the server.
		- The PUT method updates whatever currently exists on the web server with something else.
		- The DELETE method removes the resource.
	- ==The *path* is the representation of where the resource is stored on the web server.==
	- There are multiple *versions* of the HTTP protocol. Versions 1.1 and 2.0 are the most used.
	- ==*Headers* contain additional information about the request and the client that is making the request.== For certain requests methods, the request will also contain a body of content that the client is sending.
- *HTTP responses* follow a format similar to the request format. 
	- Following the header, the response will optionally contain a message body consisting of the response contents such as the HTML document, the image file and so forth
	![[HTTP Response.png]]
	- *HTTP status codes* contained within the header indicate if the HTTP request successfully completed. The code values are in the range of 100-599 and are grouped by purpose. There are five groups of status codes. They are grouped by the first digit of the error number.
		- ==Informational== is grouped 100-199: provisional responses sent by the server. These responses are interim before the actual response. The most common information response is 100 continue, which indicates that the web client should continue to request or ignore the response if the request is already finished.
		- ==Successful== responses are grouped from 200-299: indicate that the request was successfully processed by the web server, with the most common success response being 200 OK.
		- ==Redirection== message are 300-399: indicate to the web client that the requested resource has been moved to a different path. The most common response codes used are 301 moved permanently and 302 found. The difference between the redirection messages 301 and 302 is that 302 indicates a temporary redirection. When web browsers receive these responses, they will automatically submit the request for the resource at the new path.
		- ==Client error== responses range from 400-499: indicate that the requests contained bad syntax or content and cannot be processed by the web server. The most common codes used are 400 is used when the web browser or client submitted bad data to the web server, 401 is used to indicate that the user must log into an account before the request can be processed, 403 is used to indicate the request was valid, but that the web server is refusing to process it. This is often used to indicate that a user does not have sufficient permissions to execute an action in a web application, 404 is used to indicate that the request resource was not found on the web server.
		- ==Server error== responses are 500-599: indicate that a failure occurred on the web server while trying to process the request. The most common code used is 500 internal server error, which is a generic error status indicating that the server failed to process the request.![[HTTP Status Codes.png]]
-  ==*HTTPS* is the secure version of HTTP. It is used for secure communication between two computers so that nobody else can see the information being sent and received. It does this by using something called *encryption*.==
	- Like in HTTP, the requests and responses still behave in the same way and have the same content. The big difference is that before the content is sent, it is turned into a secret code. ==Only the other computer can turn the secret code back into its original content.==
- Summary: 
	- Firstly, ==HTTP is a protocol used by web clients and web servers.==
	- It works to transfer web resources such as HTML files, and ==is the foundation of any data exchanges on the web.== 
	- By using HTTPS, we send the information securely. 
	- Requests are sent by the client, usually a web browser, and the server replies with responses which may be the return of an image or an HTML page. 
	- HTTPS requests have a syntax that includes method, path, versions and headers. HTTP responses follow a similar format to the request. 
	- HTTP status codes indicate whether the HTTP requests successfully completed. The status code is a three-digit number that corresponds with groups representing different types of results.

> HTTP Examples
- *HTTP Request Headers* 
	- There are various possibilities when including an HTTP header in the HTTP request.
	- Common headers are:
		- The *Host* header specifies the ==host of the server== and indicates where the resource is requested from.
		- The *User-Agent* header informs the web server of the ==application that is making the request==. It often includes the operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux), version and application vendor.
		- The *Accept* header informs the web server ==what type of content the client will accept as the response.== The Accept-Language header indicates the language and optionally the locale that the client prefers.
		- The *Content-type* header indicates the ==type of content being transmitted in the request body.==
```
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.9; rv:50.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/50.0
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en
Content-type: text/json
```
- *HTTP Request Body*  
	- HTTP requests can optionally include a request body. A request body is often included when using the HTTP POST and PUT methods to transmit data.
```
POST /users HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

{
 "key1":"value1",
 "key2":"value2",
 "array1":["value3","value4"]
}
```

```
PUT /users/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-type: text/json

{"key1":"value1"}
```
- *HTTP Response Headers*
	- Common response headers are:
		- The *Date* header specifies the date and time the HTTP response was generated. 
		- The *Server* header describes the web server software used to generate the response. 
		- The *Content-Length* header describes the length of the response. 
		- The *Content-Type* header describes the media type of the resource returned (e.g. HTML document, image, video).
```
Date: Fri, 11 Feb 2022 15:00:00 GMT+2
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Linux)
Content-Length: 84
Content-Type: text/html
```
- *HTTP Response Body* 
	- This is the main content of the HTTP response. This can contain images, video, HTML documents and other media types.
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 11 Feb 2022 15:00:00 GMT+2
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Linux)
Content-Length: 84
Content-Type: text/html

<html>
  <head><title>Test</title></head>
  <body>Test HTML page.</body>
</html>
```

> Other Internet Protocols
- ==HTTP are used on top of TCP to transfer webpages and other content from websites==. This reading explores other protocols commonly used on the Internet
- *Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)*
	- Computers need IP addresses to communicate with each other. 
	- ==DHCP is used to assign your computer an IP address.== Your computer communicates over UDP using the protocol with a type of server called a DHCP server. The server keeps track of computers on the network and their IP addresses. It will assign your computer an IP address and respond over the protocol to let it know which IP address to use. 
	- Once your computer has an IP address, it can communicate with other computers on the network.
- *Domain Name System Protocol (DNS)*
	- Your computer needs a way to know with which IP address to communicate when you visit a website in your web browser, for example, meta.com. 
	- The Domain Name System Protocol, commonly known as DNS, provides this function. Your computer then checks with the ==DNS server associated with the domain name and then returns the correct IP address.==
- *Secure Shell Protocol (SSH)* 
	- When you start working with servers, you'll also need a way to log in and interact with the computer remotely. The most common method of doing this is using the Secure Shell Protocol, commonly referred to as SSH.
	- Using an ==SSH client allows you to connect to an SSH server running on a server to perform commands on the remote computer. All data sent over SSH is encrypted.== This means that third parties cannot understand the data transmitted. Only the sending and receiving computers can understand the data.

> Webpages, Websites and Web Apps
- ==Web pages at a particular domain make up a website==, and that the key difference between websites, but what about web applications?
- ==A website is more informative and a *web application* is more interactive.==
	- Dynamically updated content. 
	- Personalized content. 
	- A high level of interactivity.

> Developer tools
- Most web browsers come equipped with a set of developer tools that allow developers to inspect their HTML, CSS and Javascript code. 
	- Also, to trace http request to the web server, investigate performance issues and review web page security.
- Open Developer tools in Google Chrome by right-clicking and clicking Inspect. 
	- ==*Elements tab*: inspect the documents, HTML elements and their properties.==
	- ==*Console tab:* outputs, javascript logs and errors from your web application.== 
	- ==*Sources tab*: shows all content resolved for the current page.== It includes HTML, CSS, Javascript, images and videos.
	- ==*Network tab*: inspect the timeline and details of http requests and responses for the web page.== 
	- ==*Performance tab*: shows what the web browser is doing over time.== It is useful if your web application is running slow because you can pinpoint the functions that are taking the most time. 
	- ==*Memory tab*: displays the parts of your code that are consuming the most resources.==

> Frameworks and libraries
- Developers use already developed frameworks and libraries in their application development. 
	- These might be open source, meaning that the source code is freely-available for anyone to modify and build from. 
	- There are thousands of open source libraries and frameworks available or there might be proprietary, ones that are licensed or developed internally.
- ==*Libraries* are reusable pieces of code that can be used by your application.== They are purpose-built to provide a specific functionality.
	- Like a validating an email address
- *Frameworks* on the other hand provide a structure for developers to build with, where the developer provides their own code that the framework interacts with.
	- For example, there are many frameworks for developing web applications. ==These frameworks handle functionality that is common to all web applications such as receiving HTTP requests and sending HTTP responses.==
- ==Most frameworks use many libraries. The libraries that the framework uses can be used for your application.==
- Frameworks are considered opinionated and libraries are considered unopinionated.![[Frameworks and Libraries.png]]
- The benefit of this is that frameworks can replace libraries as needed. For example when new technologies become available frameworks to find the libraries flow and control of an application, whereas with the libraries those are left to the developer to decide. ![[Frameworks vs. Libraries.png]]

> APIs and Services
- *API* is the acronym for application programming interface. 
	- ==An API is a set of functions and procedures for creating applications that access the features or data of an operating system, application or other service.==
- Some common API's that web developers work with include Browser, API REST API and Sensor-Based API.
- In Software development, API's are often the bridge between different components or systems. ==This earns them names like *gateway* or *middleware*.== ![[Gateway or Middleware.png]]
- One common type of API, is *Browser* or *Web APIs*, which are built into the browser itself. 
	- They extend the functionality of the browser by adding new services and are designed to simplify complex functions and provide easy syntax for building advanced features. 
	- A good example, is the *DOM API*.
		- The DOM API turns the html document into a tree of nodes that are represented as JavaScript objects.
- ==Another critical type of API for web development is the *RESTful* or *REST API*. This kind of API provides data for popular web and mobile apps. These are also called *web servers*.== ![[REST API.png]]
	- REST or representational state transfer, is a set of principles that help build highly efficient API's. 
	- One of the main responsibilities of these kinds of API's is sending and receiving data to and from a centralized database. 
	- ==*RESTtful API which as you've learned is a web server that provides responses to requests.*== These API web servers are designed to provide the data backbone for a web client like a web page or mobile app. 
		- This means that these API's must be able to accomplish things like getting data or creating data. API issues, REST principles and good design practices to create discoverable interfaces. This helps us get the exact response expected.
	- We can query our own REST API or third party ones.
	- ==These API's use endpoints to specify how different resources can be accessed. The endpoint is built into the URL when accessing the API.== 
	- ==Once the endpoint is hit, the API performs whatever service side processing is needed to build the response.== 
	- ==Two common forms of response are, full web pages and data form based on JavaScript called *JSON*.==
- *Sensor-Based API*. This is what the internet of things also known as *IOT* is based on. These are actual physical senses that are interconnected with each other. 
	- The sensors can communicate through API and track and respond to physical data. Some examples are Philips hue, smart lights and node bots.

> IDE
- ==An integrated development environment or *IDE* is software for building applications.== An IDE is just like a text editor except instead of writing documents you're writing code.
