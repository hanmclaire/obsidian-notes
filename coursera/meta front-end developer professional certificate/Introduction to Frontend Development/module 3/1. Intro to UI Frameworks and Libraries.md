> Working with libraries
- Libraries and frameworks are often referred to as ==dependencies==. Your application depends on them. 
	- On the front end, you do this by referencing the JavaScript or CSS files in your HTML file.
- What happens if your dependency also depends on other libraries and frameworks? This is known as a ==dependency tree==.

	- A project could have hundreds of dependencies and its tree, it will take a very long time to download, setup, and configure all of them. How do you make sure you're using the same versions the rest of your team is using? This is where package managers come in. 
- ==A package manager is a tool that automatically downloads and installs dependencies==. We also refer to dependencies as ==packages==. 
	- ==A package manager also provides the capability to publish your own packages.==
	- For each dependency, you can specify a version of that dependency and the package manager will download it for you.

	- If there is a dependency tree, the package manager takes care of that for you. It will automatically download all of the dependency tree so that you can use APIs without dependency issues. 
	- ==The most common package manager for front end development is the Node Package Manager or npm==.
- Now that all your dependencies are downloaded, you need to include them in your HTML file. ==But adding all of them into an HTML file would take forever. This is where you will use a bundling tool==.

	- The purpose of a bundler is to automatically combine them into a single file. 
	- If you're bundle is significantly large, many bundles can split your dependencies into multiple bundles.
	- There are many bundle is available such as Gulp and Webpack.

> Introduction to responsive design 
- ==Responsive design means that a web page can automatically stretch or shrink depending on the screen is displayed on==.
- The ==resolution== of your screen refers to the number of pixels it contains most often expressed as the number of horizontal pixels multiplied by the number of vertical pixels. 
	- For example, a common computer screen resolution is 1920 pixels in width 1080 pixels in height.
- Responsive design is a set of three practices that allows a website to automatically change its visuals. In other words, to respond based on the device it is displayed on. It is the combination of three techniques, flexible grids, fluid images and media queries.
	- Flexible grids are made up of columns, gutters and margins. 
		- The space between the columns is called the gutter and the spaces between the content and the left and right edges of the screen are called margins.
		- Instead of defining website Element sizes based on pixels, ==flexible grids are defined in percentage values==, allowing them to adjust depending on screen size.

	- Fluid images by ==setting the CSS max width property of images to 100%==. 
		- The images will scale down smaller if they're containing column becomes narrower than the images size but never grow larger.
		- This enables an image to scale down to fit in a flexibly sized column rather than overflow it but not grow larger and become pixelated if the column becomes wider than the image.
	- ==Media queries that are part of CSS==. They allow developers to query the display size, orientation ,and aspect ratio to conditionally apply CSS rules.
- In responsive design, the pixel value specified is often referred to as the ==breakpoint==.
	- A breakpoint is the point at which a website's content and layout will adapt to provide the best possible user experience.
- A Breakpoint can function in different ways across three different grids a fixed grid, fluid grid, and hybrid grids.
