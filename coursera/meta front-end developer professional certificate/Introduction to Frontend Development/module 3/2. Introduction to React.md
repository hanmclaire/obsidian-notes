> Static and dynamic content
- Websites will often provide you with personalized recommendations. How websites adapt to different user profiles? 
- By now, you know that when you open a website, ==a web server sends the website's content to your browser. The content can be static or dynamic.== 
	- ==Static content== is files that the server transfers just as they are stored on the web server, such as videos or images. 
	- ==Dynamic content, on the other hand, is generated when the HTTP request is made.==
		- What actually happens, is that the web server communicates with another kind of server, called an ==application server== or a back-end.
		- The application server generates the dynamic content that the web server sends back to the user's browser.

- ==Application servers perform more complex processing than web servers.==
	- For instance, they have to run the application logic, communicate with the database, and check permissions. 
- You can even create your own application servers, such as building a ==back-end for a web application==
- If dynamic content is slower to generate, isn't that a problem for big websites? Yes, it is. 
	- ==Application servers typically have a limited capacity on how many requests they can process per second==. 
	- But fortunately, this is where the web server can help out. Web servers use a process called ==caching== instead of generating content dynamically for every request. 
	- ==Caching means the web server keeps a copy of dynamic content.== If the content is requested again, the web server can immediately send this cached version instead of passing the request again to the application server. 
	- On the first request for dynamic content, the web server checks if the content exists in the cache. If it does not exist, the content is requested from the application server and stored in the cache. The web server then sends back the dynamic content to the browser. 
	- On subsequent requests, the web server immediately sends back the content stored in the cache. This reduces the amount of dynamic content that the application server has to generate.
	- ==Then, after a period of time or with the next user interaction, the web server updates the cache with the latest content.==

> Single page applications
- Before the advent of modern JavaScript frameworks, most websites were implemented as ==multi-page applications==.
	- But this makes traditional applications resource intensive to web servers because sending entire web pages for every request consumes excessive bandwidth and ==uses CPU time to generate dynamic pages==.
	- If your website is complex, the site browsing experience may appear slow to users. It will be even slower if they have a poor or limited internet connection.
	![[Multi-Page Applications.png]]
- To solve this problem, many web developers build their web applications as ==SPAs==. It's called single-page, but that doesn't mean your website has only one page of content.
	- What it means is that there is ==only one HTML page that gets sent from the server to the browser, but that page will update its content as your users interact with your website.== 
	- A SPA allows the user to interact with the website without the application needing to download entire new web pages. Instead, it rewrites the current web page as the user interacts with it.
	- The result is a browsing experience that feels faster and more responsive to user input.
- A SPA has two approaches to serving code and resources. ==The first is called bundling, and the second approach is known as lazy loading or code splitting.== 
	- With bundling, when the browser requests the application, ==the server returns and loads all necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript immediately==.
	- With lazy loading, the browser requests the application and ==the server returns only the minimum HTML, CSS, and JavaScript needed to load the application.== Additional resources are downloaded as required.
- In an SPA, when the button is clicked, ==the browser will send a post request to the web server. The web server will return a JSON object==.
	![[Single Page Application.png]]
	- The application reads the object and updates by displaying the text of the movie name. 
	- That's more efficient because the rest of the page remains as it was and it's content does not need to be sent by the server and rendered by the browser.
- But what if you need to update the ==majority of the page to display a different form of content==?
	- ==In a single-page application, different pages are broken into templates, also known as views==. Each view will have HTML code that can be updated by the application.
	- The web browser sends the request to the web server and the web server sends back a file called a JSON object. This contains only the data to be displayed, such as the user's first name and last name, and the ==SPA will update the HTML==.
	- ==This is much smaller than sending an entire web page.== The web browser then updates the web page by inserting the template with items replaced by the values in the JSON object. 
- ==Remember that a single-page application has two methods of delivery resources. Delivering all resources immediately or delivering resources dynamically as required.==
	- If all resources are delivered when the application is loaded, the single-page application must include the views for every page on initial load.
	- If resources are loaded dynamically, the single-page application requests the views as required and stores views in the browser for subsequent requests.

> What is React?
- React is focused on working with components, which makes it simple to build functional user interfaces on web and mobile.
- Developers use ==React to develop single page applications== and you can also develop mobile applications with React native.
- It encourages the creation of ==reusable UI components which present data that changes over time==.
- In a traditional JavaScript application, you need to look at what data changed and imperatively make changes to the DOM to keep it up-to-date. React takes a different approach.
	- When your component is first initialized, the `render` method is called, generating a lightweight representation of your view. 
		- From that representation, a string of markup is produced and injected into the document.
	- When your data changes, the `render` method is called again.
		- In order to perform updates as efficiently as possible, we diff the return value from the previous call to render with the new one and generate a minimal set of changes to be applied to the DOM.
	- The data returned from render is neither a string nor a DOM node — it’s a lightweight description of what the DOM should look like. We call this process **==reconciliation==**

> How React works
- How do React components turn into the elements on the web page that you use?
	- Remember when your web browser receives an HTML page, it constructs a DOM, to represent it. 
	- But updating the DOM is considered expensive, because it is very time intensive for the web browser to do so. ==Every time the browser DOM is updated, it causes the browser to re-compute the page.== 
	- ==React solves the problem, by computing its own virtual DOM.==
- Let's start with how React components relate to the website displayed in your browser.
	- A React component, has a one to one relationship to an HTML element that is displayed on the webpage. 
	- ==A React application is built up of a tree of components called the Component Hierarchy==
	- But how does React keep track of which HTML elements need to be updated? This is where reacts virtual DOM comes into play.
	- ==When React builds out its tree of components, it builds out its own dome in memory called the virtual DOM.==
		- The virtual DOM is a representation of the browser DOM that is kept in memory. 
		- ==React uses this virtual DOM to update the browser DOM, only when it needs to.==
		- React checks to see if the HTML components in the virtual DOM matches the browser DOM. If a change is required, the browser dome is updated. If nothing has changed, then no update is performed. This process is called ==reconciliation==.
			![[Virtual DOM.png]]
- Let's break down what happens when you update a component and React.
	- Firstly, the virtual DOM is updated.
	- Then React, compares the virtual DOM to the previous version of the virtual DOM, and determines which elements have changed.
	- The changed elements, and only those elements are updated in the browser DOM. 
	- Changes on the browser DOM, cause the displayed web page to change.

> Virtual DOM
- As updating the browser DOM can be a slow operation, this process helps to reduce the number of ==updates to the browser DOM by only updating when it is necessary.==
- But even with this process, if a lot of elements are updated by an event, pushing the update to the browser DOM can still be expensive and cause slow performance in the web application. The React team invested many years of research into solving this problem. The outcome of that research is what’s known as the ==React Fiber Architecture.==
- This is the principle of the React Fiber Architecture==. React can optimize when and where updates occur to the browser DOM to significantly improve application performance and responsiveness to user input.== 
	- Think of it as a priority system. The highest priority changes, the elements visible to the user, are updated first. While lower priority changes, the elements not currently displayed, are updated later.

> JavaScript libraries commonly used with React
- React is a library and not a framework. This means you'll often use other JavaScript libraries with it to build your application. In this reading, you will be briefly introduced to some JavaScript libraries commonly used with React.
	- Lodash: provides common logic such as these as a utility library to save you time as a developer.
	- Redux: It helps you manage your application state and even has advanced features such as undo and redo.
	- Jest: automated tests for your code
